This is the repo for Douglas' and Kris' 2023 SDD Assessment Task 2.

# Planning

## Defining the Solution

Our final goal is to create a completely playable tile-based RPG game using `pygame`. This game will have the following features:

- Open-world Map
- Combat system
- Health system
- Characters
    - Player
    - Monsters
    - NPCs
- Storyline
- Experience and leveling system

In order to achieve a good result with a clean codebase, we will be splitting the game into modules:

- Main Logic (main game behaviour)
- Characters (player and other NPC behaviour)
- Items (item behaviour)
- Map (map and tiles)
- GUI (everything related to rendering)
- Input and Events
- Utility (small useful functions)
