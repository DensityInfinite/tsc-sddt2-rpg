# Planning

## Defining the Solution

Our final goal is to create a completely playable tile-based RPG game using `pygame`. This game will have the following features:

- Open-world Map
- Combat system
- Health system
- Characters
  - Player
  - Monsters
  - NPCs
- Storyline
- Experience and leveling system

In order to achieve a good result with a clean codebase, we will be splitting the game into modules:

- Main Logic (main game behaviour)
- Player (player behaviour)
  - Movement
  - Combat
- Enemies (enemy behaviour)
- NPCs (NPC dialogue, etc.)
- Items (item behaviour)
- Map (map and tiles)
- GUI (everything related to rendering)
- Input and Events
- Utility (small useful functions)

### Steps

1. Construct storyline
2. Build basic `pygame` framework
3. Construct Modules
   1. Input and Events
   2. GUI
   3. Player Movement
   4. Map

   8. NPCs and Dialogue (If have time)
   9. Utility (Add on the way)

### Possible Problems
